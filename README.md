ROSE - Real Time Operating System Experiment

ROSE has a tiny kernel which supports

1. Preemptive kernel
2. Kernel timers
3. Mutex
4. Semaphores
5. Events
6. Memory byte/block pool
7. Message queues
8. Interrupts

I have currently added support to test the kernel on a x86 environment using macro CONFIG_X86_SIMULATOR. In simulator mode it help to easily fix kernel bugs.
Currently trying to add support for Raspberry Pi. Working on a Kernel API documentation.

Folder structure :

apps/ - The actual application using the kernel apis
arch/ - Arch specific code

kernel/ - Rose kernel files
kernel/include - Rose kernel include files

x86.sh - Builds a x86 rose simulator

X86 SIMULATOR:

To build a binary for X86 simulator run x86.sh. Add the application files in the app/ folder and build the kernel. An exceutable named 'rosex86' will be created.
Also the simulator needs system ticks which can be generated using system_clk_100ms or system_clk_10ms executable files generated using scripts/send_signal.c. After running the kernel the tick executable should be run in another shell(in the same folder as 'rosex86')
